# Mimi's 2024 AOC Manifesto

I've been doing AOC for a few years now but never to completion. Oftentimes I'd feel very competitive in leaderboards and get discouraged when puzzles get harder and gets more time consuming.

This year I've got some free-ish time on my hands and decided to pick an easy language, and finally make an effort to complete the challenge entirely. (That's the goal, anyways!)

#### The Plan
- __Try to finish it all. All of them.__ 
- __If stuck: Look to other solutions and document them. Try to adapt it to my own code.__

  *Hey Mimi, isn't that stealing?*
  
  Well. YES. Every piece of code I take from elsewhere will be credited and I'll try to adapt it to my own. The point isn't to be the smartest or the fastest or the cleanest but to document my messes & learn to be less messy.

- __Don't kill myself over it?__

  SLEEP >>>>> STARS. I've been bad with this in the past and it's NOT worth it.

- __Don't use GPT to generate any code.__ 

  Using GPT feels like it defeats the point of learning as the main goal of the challenge.

#### Mimi's Mantra
- Steal knowledge and absorb them Kirby style
- Stay silly
- Survive
